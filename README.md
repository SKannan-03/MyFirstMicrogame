# MyFirstMicrogame
Project Title: "My First Microgame" 

Description: Briefly describe your game and customization. 
My first person shooter game has different rooms with a variety of enemies. I customized it through adding more enemies to make it more diffucult

Setup Instructions: For this assignment I completed the tutorial no setup needed.


Reflection: 50-100 words on what you learned, what worked well, and any challenges. 
During this tutorial i learned unity basics. First i was introduced to untiy and how to navigate its many levels and catagories. next i was using assets to add rooms and enemies to the game. This allowed me to create a customized game which was much harder to beat. Next we add a different floor color for a more pleasant look. I made mine a light grey to make it plain and not overly bright or takign away from the games real focus. Overall it was really fun to make and edit as it thaught me the basics so i can learn more in the future.
